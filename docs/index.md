!!! note

    The documentation/notes within this site are a constant work in progress. I often quickly "brain dump" and return later to clean things up. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

## Navigating and reading the Docs

The left sidebar contains the main/categorical sections of the docs. The right sidebar contains the table of contents for each main section.

### Annotations

Material for mkdocs has an annotations feature that I use heavily to insert important information within code blocks. If you see one, read it. They look like this - (1).
{ .annotate }

1.  :-)

Be advised, that for certain code blocks a `#` will appear before the annotation symbol. It is *not* part of any code that I am showing. It is simply a bug with the way the theme renders annotations within code blocks for certain languages.

### Admonitions

Material for mkdocs has an admonitions feature that I attempt to make good use of throughout my documentation.
