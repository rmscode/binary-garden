# Archives

Instead of deleting notes/docs that are no longer relevant, incorrect, or outdated, I've decided to archive them here. This way, I can still reference them if needed, but they won't clutter up the main notes/docs section.

I've come up with the following format for categorizing the reasons for archiving a note or doc:

- **Outdated**: The information is no longer accurate or relevant.
- **Incorrect**: The information is incorrect or inaccurate.
- **Redundant**: The information is duplicated elsewhere.
- **Deprecated**: The information is still accurate but is no longer recommended or supported.
- **Other**: None of the above reasons apply.
