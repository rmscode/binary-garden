# Continuous Availability

Continuous Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational without interruption, even in the face of failures. This is crucial for businesses that require their services to be accessible 24/7.

## Achieving Continuous Availability

Continuous Availability is typically achieved through a combination of High Availability (HA) and Fault Tolerance (FT).

### High Availability (HA)

High Availability ensures that a system is operational for a high percentage of time by minimizing downtime. This is achieved through:

- **Redundancy**: Having multiple instances of critical components so that if one fails, another can take over.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing workloads across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a point of failure.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically switching to a standby system in case of a failure.

### Fault Tolerance (FT)

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue functioning even when one or more of its components fail. This is achieved through:

- **Replication**: Duplicating critical components and data to ensure availability in case of a failure.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Identifying and correcting errors without interrupting the system's operation.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically detecting and recovering from faults.

By combining High Availability and Fault Tolerance, systems can achieve Continuous Availability, ensuring uninterrupted access to services and minimizing the impact of failures.
