# Windows Monthly Udates Explained

Monthly updates are cumulative and include all previously released fixes to guard against fragmentation of the OS. This contributes to the reliability and quality of the Windows platform.

## Monthly Security Updates

Published on the second Tuesday of each month (also referred to as "Patch Tuesday"), security updates are cumulative. That is, they include both new and previously released security fixes along with non-security content introduced in the prior month's optional non-security preview release. These updates help keep Windows devices secure and compliant by deploying stability fixes and addressing security vulnerabilities.

!!! note

    People tend to use "B release," quality update, security update, and LCU interchangeably.

## Optional Non-Security Preview Releases

Available the fourth week of the month, these production-quality updates are released ahead of the planned security update release for the following month. In addition, new features may initially be deployed in the prior month's optional non-security preview release, then ship broadly in the following month's security release.

!!! note

    The term “optional non-security preview release” now replaces what Microsoft used to call either a “C” or “D” release to align with the current process.

Optional non-security preview releases are also cumulative and are only offered for the most recent supported versions of Windows (As of this writing: Windows 10, version 22H2 and Windows 11, versions 21H2 and 22H2).

Starting in April 2023, Microsoft now targets optional non-security preview releases for the fourth week of the month. They have found this to be the optimal time to publish these updates. That's two weeks after your latest monthly security update and about two weeks before you'll see these features become part of the next mandatory cumulative update. We're excited for this improvement as it is meant to optimize the validation of payloads, improve consistency, and enhance the predictability of your testing, update, and upgrade experience.

To access optional non-security preview releases, navigate to Settings > Windows Update > Advanced options > Optional updates, select from the available updates, and click Download and install.
