# RAID

## RAID 0

### Overview

RAID 0, also known as striping, distributes data across multiple disks to improve read and write performance. It does not provide any redundancy.

### Use Cases

- High-performance applications
- Temporary storage where data loss is acceptable
- Video editing and rendering

### Pros

- Improved performance for both read and write operations
- Full disk capacity utilization

### Cons

- No fault tolerance; a single disk failure results in total data loss
- Not suitable for critical data storage

### Comparison

- **RAID 0 vs. RAID 1**: RAID 0 offers better performance but lacks redundancy.
- **RAID 0 vs. RAID 5**: RAID 0 provides higher performance but no data protection, unlike RAID 5.

## RAID 1

### Overview

RAID 1, also known as mirroring, duplicates the same data onto two or more disks. This provides redundancy but does not improve performance significantly.

### Use Cases

- Critical data storage requiring high availability
- Operating system partitions
- Small to medium-sized databases

### Pros

- High data redundancy and fault tolerance
- Simple implementation and recovery

### Cons

- Effective storage capacity is halved
- Limited performance improvement for write operations

### Comparison

- **RAID 1 vs. RAID 0**: RAID 1 offers redundancy at the cost of performance and storage capacity.
- **RAID 1 vs. RAID 10**: RAID 10 combines mirroring and striping for both redundancy and performance but requires more disks.

## RAID 5

### Overview

RAID 5 uses striping with parity distributed across all disks. It provides a good balance of performance, storage efficiency, and redundancy.

### Use Cases

- File and application servers
- Enterprise databases
- Environments with limited disk resources

### Pros

- Fault tolerance with the ability to withstand a single disk failure
- Efficient use of disk capacity
- Good read performance

### Cons

- Write performance is impacted due to parity calculation
- Complex rebuild process in case of disk failure

### Comparison

- **RAID 5 vs. RAID 0**: RAID 5 provides fault tolerance while RAID 0 does not.
- **RAID 5 vs. RAID 6**: RAID 6 offers better fault tolerance with double parity but at a higher cost.

## RAID 6

### Overview

RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but with double parity, allowing it to withstand the failure of two disks.

### Use Cases

- Large-scale data storage requiring high availability
- Environments where extended rebuild times are a concern

### Pros

- Enhanced fault tolerance with double parity
- Good read performance

### Cons

- Higher write performance overhead compared to RAID 5
- Reduced effective storage capacity due to double parity

### Comparison

- **RAID 6 vs. RAID 5**: RAID 6 offers higher fault tolerance but at the expense of write performance.
- **RAID 6 vs. RAID 10**: RAID 10 provides better performance but lower fault tolerance.

## RAID 10 (1+0)

### Overview

RAID 10 combines the features of RAID 0 and RAID 1, offering both striping and mirroring. It provides high performance and redundancy but requires a minimum of four disks.

### Use Cases

- High-performance and high-reliability applications
- Large databases and transaction processing systems
- Virtualization environments

### Pros

- Excellent read and write performance
- High fault tolerance

### Cons

- High cost due to the requirement of multiple disks
- Effective storage capacity is halved

### Comparison

- **RAID 10 vs. RAID 0**: RAID 10 offers redundancy, unlike RAID 0.
- **RAID 10 vs. RAID 5**: RAID 10 provides better performance and simpler rebuild process but at a higher disk cost.

## Summary

| RAID Level | Minimum Disks  | Fault Tolerance | Read Performance | Write Performance | Storage Efficiency |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| RAID 0     | 2              | None            | High             | High              | 100%               |
| RAID 1     | 2              | High            | Moderate         | Moderate          | 50%                |
| RAID 5     | 3              | Moderate        | High             | Moderate          | 67%-94%            |
| RAID 6     | 4              | High            | High             | Low               | 50%-88%            |
| RAID 10    | 4              | High            | High             | High              | 50%                |

## Choosing the Right RAID Level

When selecting a RAID level, consider the following factors:

- **Performance Requirements**: If performance is critical, RAID 0 or RAID 10 may be suitable.
- **Data Redundancy**: For high redundancy, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, or RAID 10 are better options.
- **Storage Efficiency**: RAID 5 and RAID 6 offer better storage efficiency compared to RAID 1 and RAID 10.
- **Cost**: RAID 10 is costlier due to the need for more disks.

!!! note

    Always ensure regular backups regardless of the RAID level used, as RAID is not a substitute for a proper backup strategy.
