# Notepad++

## Cloud Sync

1. Go to **Settings** > **Preferences** > **Cloud & Link**
2. Select the radio button for **Set your cloud location path here** and set the path to your cloud synced directory
    - For example: `C:\Users\user\OneDrive - Northeast Precast, LLC\Notepad++`</br>
    > Personally, I used a path to a cloned github repository. 
3. Restart Notepad++ and it will begin keeping a copy of files from `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Notepad++` to your cloud synced directory.

!!! note

    Regarding sessions, perhaps the best way to share those across computers is to use the *Load Session* and *Save Session* options in the **File** menu.
