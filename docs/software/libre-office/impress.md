# Libre Office Impress

Impress is free and open source software (FOSS) similar to Microsoft PowerPoint. It is part of the Libre Office suite of programs.

## Create and View Speaker Notes

Just like PowerPoint, Impress allows you to create speaker notes that are not visible to the audience. To view and create speaker notes, click on the **View** menu and select **Notes**.

To view the speaker notes from the presenter's view, start the slide show (F5) and click on the **Notes** button in the bar at the bottom of the screen.
