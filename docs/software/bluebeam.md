!!! info 

    Some plug-ins require elevated permissions before changes can be saved in Revu Administrator. This may not be obvious, as Revu will not prompt you to sign in with a local administrator account. For example, if you launch Revu Administrator with a non-admin account, activate or deactivate the Outlook plug-in, and then save the change, the change will not actually be saved.
