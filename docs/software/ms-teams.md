# Microsoft Teams

## Outlook Add-in Missing

Dealt with a few users who ran into this issue. Unsure of what lead to the problem on their machines, but I was able to replicate the issue on my own machine after uninstalling classic Teams...I had the "new" Teams and classic Teams running side by side.

1. Open Settings (Windows+I) and click **Apps**
2. Search for "Teams" and select "Microsoft Teams Meetting Add-in For Microsoft..."
3. Click **Modify**
4. Choose the repair option in the next window that appears
5. Restart Outlook
6. Outlook > Options > Add-ins > COM Add-ins > Go > Check "Microsoft Teams Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office"
