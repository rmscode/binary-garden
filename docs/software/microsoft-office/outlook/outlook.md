### Mailbox Disconnected

After adding a second mailbox to Outlook, my main mailbox would not connect to exchange. Tried some of the methods in the NEP docs, but here is what worked for me:

1. Control Panel > User Accounts > Mail
2. Open "Data Files"
3. Create new data file
4. Select "Email tab" and delete all email accounts
5. Re-add email accounts from same tab by selecting "new".
6. Relaunch Outlook and sign in when prompted.
