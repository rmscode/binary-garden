# Turn Track Changes On and Off

!!! info 

    If a document has been shared with you for review, you may not be able to turn off Track Changes. If you want to edit the document without tracking changes, youâ€™ll need to either save a copy or ask the person who sent it to you to share it again with review mode turned off.

Go to **Review** > **Track Changes** > Select **For Everyone/Just Mine** to enable or **Off** to disable.

- When Track Changes is on, the section is highlighted. Deletions are marked with a strikethrough, and additions are marked with an underline. Different authors' changes are indicated with different colors.
- When Track Changes is off, the section is not highlighted. Word stops marking changes, but the colored underlines and strikethroughs are still in the document.

If unaccepted changes are present in the document, they need to be accepted or rejected before tracking can be stopped.

In **Review** > **Reject** > Select Accept or Reject All Changes and Stop Tracking
