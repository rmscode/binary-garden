# Hide Images in a Document

!!! info "What the frick Microsoft?"

    This is frustrating and hilarious at the same time. This month's update (March 2024) ***removed*** the "Show Pictures Placeholders" option from Word...[Source](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/show-picture-placeholders-removed-from-wordno/e336ac69-b04d-4656-8a67-b92ef006559d).

    Update: A few hours later someone followed up on that post above . . . The loss of that option is being "investigated".

Sometimes, larges documents with lots of images can be difficult to work with because it may slow the program down.

*The images below are from Word for Microsoft 365 but apply to 2021, 2019, 2016 and 2013 as well.*

1. Select the **File** tab in the ribbon.
