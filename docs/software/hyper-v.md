# Hyper-V

## Guest Integration Services

Hyper-V Integration Services represent a software suite of services which, when enabled, improves the integration between a host server and a VM in a virtual environment. Each Hyper-V service has a specific function aimed at enhancing the performance of guest operating systems. The degree of their impact on the VM may vary as some of the Hyper-V services are designed for providing mere convenience for users, while others are critical for the VMâ€™s functionality.

    Installing and updating integration services is one of the most commonly overlooked steps to ensure overall stability and optimal performance of guest VMs. Although newer Windows-based OSs and some enterprise-class Linux-based OSs come with integration services out of the box, updates may still be required. New versions of integration services may become available as the physical Hyper-V hosts are patched and updated.

### Check Status and Version

```powershell
Get-VMIntegrationService -VMName "TestVM" #(1)!
REG QUERY "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Virtual Machine\Auto" /v IntegrationServicesVersion #(2)!
```

1. Check the status of integration services for a VM.
2. Query the registry for the version of integration services.

Enable with `Enable-VMIntegrationService -VMName "TestVM" -Name "Guest Service Interface"`.

### Update

1. Open Hyper-V Manager
2. Select the VM and click **Connect**.
3. Click **Action** on the task bar above. In the drop-down menu, select **Insert Integration Services Setup Disk**.
4. Find the DVD drive which contains the Integration Services Setup Disk. Right-click on it and select Install Hyper-V Integration Services.
5. Restart the system to complete the installation.
6. After the reboot, verify that Integration Services are updated by looking at the VM summary in Hyper-V Manager.
