## Install Windows 10 & 11 Without Third-Party Apps

1. Start installing Windows 10/11 as usual.
2. On the "Language to install" screen, select either *English (World)* or *English (Europe)* from the **Time and currency format** dropdown.
3. Click **Next** and continue setting up Windows.
4. When you reach the OOBE screen, you will likely see the message "something went wrong". Click on **Skip**.
5. After the installation is complete, you can change your locale options under **Settings** > **Time & Language** > **Region** > **Regional format** dropdown.

## Uninstall DevHome

Microsoft started installing this automatically, but most users have no need for it.

1. Open Powershell.
2. Copy and paste the command below into Windows Terminal, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    1. `Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers -PackageTypeFilter Bundle -Name "*Windows.DevHome*" | Remove-AppxPackage -AllUsers`
3. When finished, you can close the PowerShell Window.

!!! note

    If you encounter issues with the command above, you probably need to make sure the AppX Deployment Service is running. Run services.msc, find and start "AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC)". A reboot will probably be needed. If that doesn't work, you may need to use the legacy loading mode with the `-UseWinPS` switch. Run `Import-Module Appx -UseWinPS` and then the command above.

## Enable High Performance Power Plan

On certain laptops, sometimes the high performance power plan is not available. To enable, run the following command in the command prompt:

```cmd
powercfg /s SCHEME_MIN
```

This definitely works for Windows 10, but should work for Windows 11 as well.

## Fix Open Windows Moving to Main Monitor After Locking/Unlocking Computer

After [replacing my monitors](../../../notes/2024.md#11112024-1556), all open windows would move to the main monitor after locking/unlocking the computer. Remove unused monitors from the display settings to fix this issue.

1. Open Display Manager as Administrator
2. Click on **View** > **Show Hidden Devices**
3. Expand **Monitors** and right-click to **Uninstall device** for every dimmed/grayed out monitor in the list.

## Display Current Power Requests

The command `powercfg /requests` is used to display the current power requests that are preventing the system from entering a lower power state, such as sleep or hibernation. It shows active requests made by applications, services, or devices that keep the computer awake. These power requests can also prevent the display from going into standby mode and certain apps from properly detecting a user's presence (away status).

!!! note

    I had issues with my personal computer not turning off the displays and locking after being away from my desk. I also noticed that social apps like Discord or Steam weren't automatically updating my status to *Away*. A few seconds of searching the web lead me to find this command. For me, it was the new RSI launcher (Star Citizen). Going to the launcher settings and disabling "background video" fixed the issue for me. Wasteful piece of eye candy that is. I thought the launcher menu's background animation was a gif or something, not a full blown video on repeat.

## Delete a file that is open in Windows Explorer

I was once met with "The action canâ€™t be completed because the file is open in Windows Explorer" when trying to delete what I thought was an empty folder in Windows 10. It turns out that there was a `Thumbs.db` file preventing me from deleting said folder.

1. In File Explorer, navigate to the parent folder of the one with the pesky file.
2. View > Layout > Change from **Details** to **List** 
3. Try deleting the folder.

!!! note

    I did have to try a few times before it worked. There was another solution on the same page linked above that suggested switching the view to "Content", renaming the `Thumbs.db` file, and then deleting the folder. I tested that and it worked as well.
