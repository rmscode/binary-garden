# Module Removal and Replacement

!!! warning " ESD Precautions"

    Parts can be damaged by electrostatic discharge. Follow these precautions:

    - Avoid hand contact by transporting and storing products in static-safe containers.
    - Keep electrostatic-sensitive parts in their containers until they arrive at static-protected workstations.
    - Place parts in a static-protected area before removing them from their containers.
    - Avoid touching pins, leads, or circuitry.
    - Always be properly grounded when touching a static-sensitive component or assembly.
    - Remove clutter (plastic, vinyl, foam) from the static-protected workstation.

To replace modules in a 2U controller enclosure that has one controller module, you must shut down all of the attached hosts before shutting down the controller module. Our system has two controller modules, so we can replace one controller module at a time without shutting down the attached hosts. See also, [Shutting Down a Controller Module](me5-shutdown-controller.md).
