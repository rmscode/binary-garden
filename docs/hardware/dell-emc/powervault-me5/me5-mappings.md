# Mapping

!!! abstract

      The ME5 docs mention "mapping" quite a bit and even refer to specific things like LUNs being mapped to volumes, but unlike the ME4 docs, there is no specific section on creating and managing these mappings...Until we are able to click around in the ME5's PowerVault manager, I have no idea how to create these kinds of mappings.
