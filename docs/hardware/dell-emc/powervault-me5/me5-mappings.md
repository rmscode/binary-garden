# Mapping

!!! abstract

    The ME5 docs mention "mapping" quite a bit and even refers to specific things like LUNs being mapped to volumes, but unlike the ME4 docs, there is no specific section for it. I did [post](https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/powervault/me5-docs-for-mapping-initiatorsvolumesluns/667481bca839cb122545431e) on the Dell forums about this. The response wasn't very helpful. I think "[Attaching volumes to hosts](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/powervault-me5084/me5_series_ag/attaching-volumes-to-hosts?guid=guid-337fb819-979a-485c-afcd-3105aa78e3bd&lang=en-us)" covers mapping.
