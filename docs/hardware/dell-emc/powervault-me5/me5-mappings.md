# Mapping

!!! abstract

      The ME5 docs mention "mapping" quite a bit and even refers to specific things like LUNs being mapped to volumes, but unlike the ME4 docs, there is no specific section on creating and managing these mappings. I did make a [post](https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/powervault/me5-docs-for-mapping-initiatorsvolumesluns/667481bca839cb122545431e) on the Dell forums about this. The response wasn't very helpful.

      The [CLI commands](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/powervault-me5024/me5_series_cli/map-volume?guid=guid-2c6cb8e3-0e85-442a-81a4-5b2cf0b8df7a&lang=en-us) for mapping volumes to initiators are the same as the ME4, so the functionality is still there...
