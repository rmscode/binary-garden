[Configuration Guide for the S4048-ON System (9.14.2.4)](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/dell-emc-os-9/s4048-on-9.14.2.4-config/about-this-guide)

!!! info

    S4048-ON is a networking switch for campus aggregation and core switching 10 Gbps servers and 40 Gbps optical uplinks to the 40 Gbps switching fabric in the core.

    The S4048-ON has:

    - Forty-eight SFP+ ports for 1/10 Gbps transceivers
    - Six fixed QSFP+ optical ports for 40Gbps transceivers
    - Serial RS 232 and Micro-USB console ports
    - One out-of-band (OOB) RJ45 management port
    - LED display for the switch, fan, and power status

## Accessing the CLI

The S4048-ON does not listen to any network out of the box, so you'll need to access the CLI via a console port for initial configuration. The easiest way is to use the micro-usb port on the front of the device.

Download the [drivers](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails/?driverid=r5k9d) onto the device you'll be using for access and then connect to the switch using the following settings:

- Baud rate: 115200
- No parity
- 8 data bits
- 1 stop bits
- No flow control

!!! note

    To [use the RS-232 console port](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/dell-emc-os-9/s4048-on-9.14.2.4-config/accessing-the-console-port?guid=guid-894f99b1-5209-4246-b75c-116c3bb5568e&lang=en-us) on the back, you'll need a rollover cable (RJ45 with a DB-9 Adapter).
