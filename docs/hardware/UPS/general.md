# General UPS Information

An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is a device that provides backup power to electronic equipment in case of a power outage or voltage drop. It ensures that devices continue to operate without interruption, protecting against data loss and hardware damage.

## Types of UPS Systems

There are three main types of UPS systems:

1. **Standby UPS**: The most basic type of UPS, the standby UPS switches to battery power when it detects a power outage. It provides basic protection against power interruptions but may not be suitable for sensitive equipment.
2. **Line-Interactive UPS**: The line-interactive UPS regulates voltage fluctuations and provides battery backup when needed. It offers better protection than a standby UPS and is suitable for most home and small business applications.
3. **Online UPS**: The online UPS provides continuous power to connected devices by converting AC power to DC power and then back to AC power. It offers the highest level of protection against power interruptions and is ideal for critical applications.

## Modes of Operation

UPS systems operate in different modes to provide power protection:

- **Line/Normal Mode**: In normal mode, the UPS conditions and then passes utility power directly to connected devices while simultaneously maintaining the battery charge.
- **Battery Mode**: When the UPS detects a power outage, it switches to battery mode to provide backup power.
- **Bypass Mode**: Some UPS systems have a bypass mode that allows utility power to bypass the UPS during maintenance, overload conditions or internal faults.
- **Eco Mode**: Eco mode allows the UPS to operate with maximum efficiency by bypassing the battery backup when utility power is stable.
