# Raspberry Pi

!!! note "For information about displaying content from a Raspberry Pi, see [PiSignage](../software/pisignage.md). As of 12/22/23, we are using [DietPi](../hardware/raspberrypi.md#diet-pi) and Chromium in kiosk mode. This allows us to update the OS and Chromium. Something we had to wait on the PiSignage developers for. This was a problem because we moved from a .NET MAUI app to Blazor WASM (for easier development) and it wouldn't work with the PiSignage build we had."

!!! tip "For a list of common Linux commands, see the [Linux Cheat Sheet](../general/linux-cheat-sheet.md)."

## VNC

The default Pi app for VNC was RealVnc. At some point that product was made free for personal use only. As of 12/11/23, RealVnc has not be removed from the Pi but it can be with the following code:

```bash
sudo apt remove realvnc-vnc-server
sudo apt remove realvnc-vnc-viewer
```

To set up a new VNC client, use the following code. Other VNC solutions give a desktop per user. They don't let you sign into the running session.

Install the extension:

```bash
sudo apt install tigervnc-xorg-extension
```

!!! note

    Tiger VNC can be easily installed in DietPi by running the `dietpi-software` commmand. It's automatically configured to be installed in the [DietPi](#diet-pi) section below.

Create an xorg config file to load the extension:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10.vnc.conf
```

Add the following to the config file:

```text
Section "Module"
  Load "vnc"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
  Identifier "Screen0"
  Option "Desktop" "<INSERT DEVICE NAME>"
  Option "SecurityTypes" "TLSPlain"
  Option "PlainUsers" "<INSERT USER NAME>"
EndSection
```

Restart the display manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
```

To connect to the Pi, download and run [vncviewer64](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/releases) from TigerVNC. Input the Pi's IP address and use the default user/password.

## Hardware Watchdog

The Raspberry Pi features a hardware watchdog that can automatically restart the system when the kernel panics (crashes).

Install watchdog system service:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install watchdog
```

### Enable the hardware watchdog timer

```bash
sudo su #(1)!
echo 'dtparam=watchdog=on' >> /boot/config.txt #(2)!
reboot
```

1. The `su` (short for substitute or switch user) utility allows you to run commands with another userâ€™s privileges, by default the root user.
2. FYI: `echo '<string>' >> <path_to_file>` appends the given string to the given file on a new line.

### Configure the timeouts and watchdog refresh intervals

```bash
sudo su
echo 'watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog' >> /etc/watchdog.conf #(1)!
echo 'watchdog-timeout = 15' >> /etc/watchdog.conf #(2)!
echo 'max-load-1 = 6' >> /etc/watchdog.conf #(3)!
echo 'RuntimeWatchdogSec=10' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf #(4)!
echo 'ShutdownWatchdogSec=10min' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf #(5)!
```

1. Specifies the device file for the hardware watchdog.
2. Specifies the period of inactivity after which the watchdog timer will expire and the system will be rebooted. This is essentially the max amount of time that can pass without the watchdog daemon "kicking" or resetting the watchdog timer before the system is considered unresponsive.
3. Specifies the max average system load over the last 1 minute, above which the watchdog reboots the system. 
4. Refreshes the watchdog every 10 seconds and if the refresh fails, power cycle the system.
5. On shutdown, if the system takes longer than 10 minutes to reboot, power cycle the system.

!!! note "Important note on `max-load-1`"

    The system load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a system performs. The value is a floating point number. For example, if set to `4` on a 4-core system, the watchdog will trigger a reboot if the 1-min load average exceeds 4, which essentially means all cores are fully utilized for the last minute. However, you typically want to set `max-load-1` to the maximum possible value, because the system might occasionally reach full utilization under normal operation. Instead, you might want to set the `max-load-1` to a value that indicates the system is overloaded. 
    
    For example, on a 4-core Raspberry Pi, you might set `max-load-1` to 5.0 or 6.0. These values indicate that the system is overloaded, because the system load is higher than the number of cores.

### Enable and check the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable watchdog
sudo systemctl start watchdog
sudo systemctl status watchdog
```

!!! tip "If you want to test the watchdog, you can "fork bomb" the system to make the kernel panic."

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c ':(){ :|:& };:'
    ```

## Diet Pi

!!! info

    DietPi is a highly optimised & minimal Debian-based Linux distribution. DietPi is extremely lightweight at its core, and also extremely easy to install and use. We primarily use it to display content on TVs via chromium's kiosk mode.

!!! note "There are [additional steps](../hardware/raspberrypi.md#raspberry-pi-5-and-4k) to get 4K working on the RPi 5."

### Installation and Intial Setup

1. Download [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/#download) and extract the `img` file from the `xz` archive with [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
2. Flash the image to an SD card. I used the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), but something else like [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) will work as well.
3. Place the SD card in the Pi and power it on.
4. Follow the prompts on the screen to be guided through the initial setup.
      - Alternatively, you can follow the [section below](#automatic-base-installation) for an automated first-boot experience.

DietPi is minimal by design, allowing you to choose what software you want ot install and use. Just run `dietpi-software` and install whichever DietPi optimized software you'd like. To make further changes to your configuration, you can run `dietpi-launcher`.

### Automatic Base Installation

The automatized setup is based on the configuration file `/boot/dietpi.txt`. It can be edited prior to the first system start and will be evaluated during the first boot procedure. On subsequent boot procedures, the options in the file are no longer evaluated. The main benefit to this method is the ability to create a "desired state" using `dietpi.txt` as a declarative model.

!!! info "Editing the contents of `/boot/dietpi.txt`"

    For the Raspberry Pi, the file is located on a FAT32 partition which can be accessed on a Windows PC. In this case, `dietpi.txt` can be found in its root.

1. After flashing, leave the SD card in your computer, navigate to the FAT32 boot partition in Windows Explorer and open the `dietpi.txt` file in a text editor of your choice.
2. Make the following changes to `dietpi.txt` or copy/paste from below and adjust as needed.
      1. Replace the following:
          - `AUTO_SETUP_LOCALE=C.UTF-8` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=gb` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=us`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_TIMEZONE=Europe/London` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_TIMEZONE=America/New_York`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_BROWSER_INDEX=-1` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_BROWSER_INDEX=-2`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_TARGET_INDEX=0` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_TARGET_INDEX=11`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_LOGIN_USER=root` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_LOGIN_USER=dietpi`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=0` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_GLOBAL_PASSWORD=dietpi` &rarr; `AUTO_SETUP_GLOBAL_PASSWORD=CHANGE_ME`
          - `SURVEY_OPTED_IN=-1` &rarr; `SURVEY_OPTED_IN=-0`
          - `CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE_ENABLE=1` &rarr; `CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE_ENABLE=0`
          - `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_WIDTH=1280` &rarr; `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_WIDTH=1920`
          - `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_HEIGHT=720` &rarr; `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_HEIGHT=1080`
          - `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_RES_X=1280` &rarr; `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_RES_X=3840`
          - `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_RES_Y=720` &rarr; `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_RES_Y=2160`
          - `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_AUTOSTART_URL=https://dietpi.com/` &rarr; `SOFTWARE_CHROMIUM_AUTOSTART_URL=https://portal.northeastprecast.com/device?key=ChangeMe`
      2. Add the following (Under `# Software to automatically install`):
          - `AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=23`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=113`
          - `AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID=28`

DietPi will now go through a one time setup process based on the options in the `dietpi.txt` file. This may take several minutes depending on the speed of the SD card and software chosen to install in `dietpi.txt`. Once complete, make sure the Pi reboots and launches Chromium in kiosk mode.

You'll notice that the cursor is still visible. To hide it, we'll have to edit the autostart file:

1. Close Chromium by pressing `Alt+F4` to reveal the terminal and run the following command:
    - `sudo nano /var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/chromium-autostart.sh`
2. Add `-- -nocursor` to the end of the last line so it looks likes this:
    - `exec "$STARTX" "$FP_CHROMIUM" $CHROMIUM_OPTS "${URL:-https://dietpi.com/}" -- -nocursor`

If the display resolution wasn't properly detected, you can manually set it in `DietPi-Config`:

1. `sudo dietpi-config`
2. Display Options > Display Resolution > 1080P : 1920 x 1080
3. Exit DietPi-Config and reboot.

### Raspberry Pi 5 and 4K

As of writing this (4/23/24), I ran into issues trying to get a Pi 5 to display 4K (adding `enable_hdmi_4kp60=1` to /boot/config.txt). The `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` log file spit out this error when attempting to launch Chromium:

```
[    13.217] (EE) Fatal server error:
[    13.217] (EE) Cannot run in framebuffer mode. Please specify busIDs for all framebuffer devices
```

The solution was to creating `99-vc4.conf` in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/` with the following contents:

```
Section "OutputClass"
  Identifier "vc4"
  MatchDriver "vc4"
  Driver "modesetting"
  Option "PrimaryGPU" "true"
EndSection
```

### Disable Boot Messages

If you prefer to not see the boot messages when the Pi is starting up, you can disable them by editing the `cmdline.txt` file. This file is located in the same FAT32 boot partition as `dietpi.txt`. You will edit this file the same way you did `dietpi.txt` - by opening it in a text editor on your computer.

The contents of the file should look something like this:

```text
root=PARTUUID=127c511a-02 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait net.ifnames=0 logo.nologo console=tty3
```

Change the `console=tty1` to `console=tty3` and add `vt.global_cursor_default=0 quiet loglevel=0 splash` to the end of the line.

## Hardening

In an attempt to "harden" a raspberry Pi deployed in the wild that may be easily accessed, like behind a lobby TV, there are few things you can do. Keep in mind that any of the methods listed below are NOT bullet proof. A highly motivated bad actor will still do whatever they can to gain access to your systems.

### Disable USB Ports

Cutting power from the USB ports will prevent a bad actor from being able to attach USB devices like a keyboard/mouse.

Install [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl):

```bash
sudo apt install -y uhubctl
```

Power off all USB ports:

```bash
sudo uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a 0 #(1)!
```

1. If you need to power the USB ports back on for any reason, you can change `-a 0` to `-a 1`.

!!! note "Note: Power *will* be restored after a reboot."

    We need to come up with a method to power off the USB ports at the end of each boot sequence. Thankfully, thats pretty easy to script using cronjobs or DietPi's autostart scripts. 

    In our environment, we use DietPi to launch chromium in kiosk mode. Adding `sudo uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a 0` the `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/chromium-autostart.sh` is easy enough.
