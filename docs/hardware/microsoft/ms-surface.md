# Microsoft Surface

## Surface RT (Gen 1 2012)

### Surface Docking Station

#### Issues with Ethernet

To resolve issues with Ethernet connectivity, try the following:

- Power cycle the dock
- Reboot the Surface
- Disconnect everything from the dock, reconnect the Surface, confirm an ethernet connection, connect everything else
- Ensure that ethernet dock setting is enabled in Surface bios
- Reinstall/Update the dock's firmware (This is what worked when I had this issue)
