# Overview

!!! info

    Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It does not include peripherals (such as keyboards, mice, and cases). However, some accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.

    As of 12/22/23, we are using [DietPi](../../software/operating-systems/linux/dietpi.md) for digital signage purposes. This allows us to update the OS and Chromium on a more regular basis. Something we had to wait on the PiSignage developers for. This was a problem because we moved from a .NET MAUI app to Blazor WASM (for easier development) and it wouldn't work with the PiSignage build we had.
