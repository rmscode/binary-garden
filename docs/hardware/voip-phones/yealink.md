## Teams Certified Phones

### MP45

!!! note

    So I picked one up because I saw a pretty good deal on ebay - $40 bucks. I used a gift card the in-laws gave me for Christmas so it was a guilt free purchase üòÅ. It's extremely basic, but works well. It's literally just plug and play. It immediately detected my personal account signed into Teams on my computer. No configuration needed. 

    The functions that you can perform from the actual phone are quite limited. You can make/take calls and place them on hold, but thats about it. Its pretty much just a dumb device that extends the calling feature of the Teams app. Anything else needs to be handled from the desktop app. When a call is placed or received on the handset, the Teams phone app on the desktop will automatically open up. I now understand why there are so many reports online of users preferring to use the soft phone with a headset. Call quality was mediocre, but I was on Wifi and quite far from my access point at the time.
