## Create a File Request

With the file request feature in OneDrive or Sharepoint, you can choose a folder where others can upload files using a link that you send them. People you request files from can only upload files; they can't see the content of the folder, edit, delete, or download files, or even see who else has uploaded files. 

1. In your OneDrive, select (not open) a folder and then select **Request files**.
2. Enter a descriptive name for the files you are requesting and click **Next**.
3. You can select **Copy link** to copy the request link and send it to anyone you would like to request files from, or you can enter the email address or addresses of the people.
4. Select **Done**.

You will recieve a notification email each time someone uploads a file to the folder.
