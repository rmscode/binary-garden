# Microsoft Volume Licensing

A program designed for organizations that need multiple licenses for Microsoft software products. Instead of purchasing retail copies, volume licensing allows businesses to acquire them in bulk at a discounted rate.

## Types of Volume Licensing

**Microsoft Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Enterprise Subscription Agreement** are commitment-based Microsoft volume licensing agreements for commercial organizations signing a new enrollment with 500 or more users/devices and government organizations with 250 or more users/devices that want to license Microsoft cloud services and/or on-premises software organization-wide, over a three-year period, and at the best available pricing.

The **Microsoft Products and Services Agreement** is a transactional Microsoft volume licensing agreement for organizations with 250 or more users/devices that want to license Microsoft cloud services and/or on-premises software as needed—with no organization-wide commitment under a single, non-expiring agreement. Software Assurance is optional.

**Microsoft Open Value and Microsoft Open Value Subscription** are for organizations with 5 to 499 users/devices that want to license Microsoft cloud services and/or on-premises software. Open Value non-organization-wide is a transactional agreement. Software Assurance is included. Open Value organization-wide and Open Value Subscription are commitment-based agreements where you agree to license certain products for your entire organization. Software Assurance is included.

The **Microsoft Customer Agreement** is a transactional licensing agreement for commercial, government, and academic organizations with one or more users/devices seeking to acquire cloud services through self-service purchases or outsource management of their cloud services through a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider program. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer an easy way to license the cloud services you need in combination with the value-added services offered by your systems integrator, hosting partner, or reseller partner. On-premises software without Software Assurance is also available through partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program.

The **Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement** is a transactional licensing agreement for commercial, government, and academic organizations with one or more users/devices that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web, through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program. On-premises software and Software Assurance are not available through the Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement.

## How to buy Volume Licensing

As of writing this, it appears that you can only purchase licenses through a Microsoft Partner unless you are under the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement.

## Software Assurance

Software Assurance spans a broad range of Microsoft software and services, including Windows, Microsoft Office, Exchange, System Center, SQL Server, and many others. These benefits can vary by volume licensing program (such as an Enterprise Agreement or Open Value Agreement), and the number of qualifying licenses you have enrolled in Software Assurance.

#### The Microsoft Workplace Discount Program

provides employees the right to acquire Microsoft products or services made available through the Microsoft Workplace Discount Program website(s). Employees may choose to purchase from either the Online Services or Software option. Neat.

#### Servers – Disaster Recovery Rights

For each Instance of eligible server software Customer runs in a Physical OSE or Virtual OSE on a Licensed Server, it may temporarily run a backup Instance in a Physical OSE or Virtual OSE on either, another one of its Servers dedicated to disaster recovery, or, for Instances of eligible software other than Windows Server, on Microsoft Azure Services, provided the backup Instance is managed by Azure Site Recovery to Azure.

#### License Mobility

Under License Mobility Across Server Farms, you can reassign licenses from one server to another within a server farm as frequently as needed. A server farm is defined as two or more servers under one management. Under License Mobility Through Software Assurance (SA), Customer may move its licensed software to shared servers under any of its Licenses which are designated as having License Mobility for which it has SA.
